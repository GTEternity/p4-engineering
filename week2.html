    <h1><center>Week 2 Review</center></h1>
    <p>
        This week, we learned a lot about TinkerCAD and safety protocols 
        when in the workshop. Starting off with TinkerCAD, we finished our 
        designs having learned to be accurate with our measurements 
        to save time in the future. We also made models of some home 
        appliences, and I chose my red toaster oven. I then learned that 
        making something detailed requires quite a bit amount of time, as 
        I was only able to get a fraction of the detail that the real 
        toaster had. I personally also learned that the challenges are 
        only to be done in class, because when I saw the assignment for 
        Challenge 2, I did it at home. However, when I did the challenge in 
        class, I scrapped the old design, which helped make it better. The 
        safety protocols including holding a majority of the tools with 
        both hands and making sure to clamp everything down for a lot of 
        tools. The one that was most focused on for those was the drill. 
        One more thing about safety is that we have to yell "Masks down!" 
        before welding, "Welding!" when welding, and "Done!" when done.
