    <p>
        This week, we only had this class on Tuesday and Thursday, because Friday was a day off. <br>
        So, on Tuesday, we learned about enIvironmental engineering. Basically, environmental engineering 
        is a branch of engineering that focuses on the environment. It could do with air pollution or water 
        filters or other stuff. It's like mechanical and/or computer engineering used for the purpose of helping 
        the environment. We also learned about the safety label with the 4 diamonds, and what everything means. 
        And 4,4,4, <s>W</s> is <i>definitely</i> safe to consume, I'm not using <i>sarcasm</i> or anything to 
        denote that I actually meant the opposite. Thursday was fun. We had to figure out how many candy corns 
        could fit flatly on a single piece of standard paper. What my team did was we lined up candy corn next to each 
        other, horizontally on one side and vertical on the other and vice versa, and found out how many could 
        fit on one side. Then we multiplied and our answer was 228 candy corns, an answer we shared with another team. 
        The amount of candy corn you can fit on a piece of paper is 222, and my group and that other group won candy 
        corn, which I raelly like as a candy. Then, we did water filtration. Our materials were big rocks, small rocks, 
        sand, and paper towels. We had to use all at least once. My group was different this time: it was me, Dante, Leo, 
        and Towa. We went with Dante's idea of paper towels, small rocks, sand, and big rocks from bottom to top. And if
        it weren't for that muck at the bottom of our bottle we would've gotten the clearest water. Unfortunately, the muck 
        stopped the water from dripping, so we could only have the water go through once, as opposed to other teams who 
        went through twice. But if we got a better bottle and our team went through twice, we would've won. We tied with 2nd 
        place, so it's not all too bad. What I learned is that you need different filters for different sizes of stuff, going 
        from largest filtered to smallest filtered.
