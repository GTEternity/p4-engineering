    <center><h2>Arduinos and Lights</h2></center>
    <p>
        This week, we learned about Arduinos! Arduinos are microcontrollers that you can use to power curcuits. We mainly 
        went into the code of Arduinos. We had to go log on to the website, and since I'm not 16 yet I needed parent 
        confirmation. So I tried to get my account confirmed, but it didn't work. You think the people who made one of the 
        best microcontrollers for beginners would have a functional website. At least with my website, <a href="rps.html">RPS</a> works! 
        However, we just used the IDEs on the provided laptops and were able to compile and upload code directly onto a connected 
        Arduino. We had a couple circuits to work on, and me and my partner Taylor breezed through them. We even made our own!

    Code and videos shown below for different circuits.
