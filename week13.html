    <center><h2>Arduinos and Lights</h2></center>
    <p>
        This week, we learned about Arduinos! Arduinos are microcontrollers that you can use to power curcuits. We mainly 
        went into the code of Arduinos. We had to go log on to the website, and since I'm not 16 yet I needed parent 
        confirmation. So I tried to get my account confirmed, but it didn't work. You think the people who made one of the 
        best microcontrollers for beginners would have a functional website. At least with my website, <a href="rps.html">RPS</a> works! 
        However, we just used the IDEs on the provided laptops and were able to compile and upload code directly onto a connected 
        Arduino. We had a couple circuits to work on, and me and my partner Taylor breezed through them. We even made our own! 
        On Friday, my half of the class was told to find out how many doors there were in CV. The other side was told to 
    find how many doors there are. Winner is the one with the biggest number. The thing that made us win: books.
    Book covers and pages are just doors to the next page. So, we estimated that the library had 5000 books with
    an average of maybe 300-500 pages each. We got a number in the millions. Apparently, the wheels would've won 
    if they made a better arguements. I then got a $5000 bounty for teaching the Gospel of the Books.
