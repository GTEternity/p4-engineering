    <p>
        This week, we learned about electrical engineering! My 9th grade math teacher who's also one of the 
        engineering teachers, Mr. Kim, was an electrical engineer. We learned that electrical engineering is 
        mainly circuits, hardware, and some coding. We also learned about different parts, like resistors, diodes, 
        and more. We also learned about circuits, like series circuits (which have things activate in series) and 
        parallel circuits (which have things activate parallel to each other). In a series circuit, if one thing 
        doesn't work, nothing after it will work either. In a parallel circuit, if one thing doesn't work, the other 
        things will still work. So, we made some of the circuits on TinkerCAD, one simple, one series, and one parallel.
