    <h1>Choosing a Design</h1>
    <h2>Group of 4</h2>
    <h3>September 7</h3>
    <p>
        We went through everyone's designs, and we decided to do Aaron's.
        <br> It consists of:
        <br> A pulley system that lets down a ball.
        <br> A ramp to bring the ball down.
        <br> A small toy car that the ball will bump into.
        <br> A needle at the front of the car that will pop the balloon.
