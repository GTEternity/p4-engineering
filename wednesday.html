        Today, we had a challenge: Use popsicle sticks and rubber band to make a holder for a water balloon that 
        about fits in the palm of your hand, and run across the P.E. track with it on a yard stick. My partners 
        were Jonah (Barty) and Towa. We worked step-by-step: First, we figured out how to tie 2 sticks together. 
        Then we would tie them in a triangle. Then, we got additional sticks that we eventually would lift up 
        and tie them together. We decided it would be held vertically, thus giving it the nickname "The Torch". 
        We then just added additional vertical supports (which ended up saving us). Jonah ran, and he got first 
        place in the run by running fast and throwing the balloon past the finish line.
