    <p>
        Today, we had to design a prosthetic for a theoretical animal. I chose a mechanical tail for a spider monkey. 
        I said mechanical tail specifically because there's no way I'm designing an electric tail that can do as much 
        as a spider monkey's tail. So I made my design in TinkerCAD, and it's not my proudest creation, but it could theoretically 
        work. It's specifically 6 pounds and about 24-36 inches long, as that's the same as a normal spider monkey tail. 
        Some things I couldn't find are the diameter of the monkey's tail, so I guessed 4 inches, and what material I could 
        use that has the right weigth, so I guessed rubber.

    Here's my design:
