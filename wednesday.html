    <h2>Sketches and TinkerCAD</h2>
    <p>
        TinkerCAD is a website where you can use a 3D environment to design different things.
        <br>In our case, it's a Rugh Goldberg Machine
        <br>My design is:
        <br>A pulley holding 2 baseballs, and one of them goes onto the ramp.
        <br>The ramp has sideguards to stop the ball from falling off the sides.
        <br>The ball then rolls down onto a lever.
        <br>The lever then launches a pin up into a balloon.
        <br>The balloon will be held by a pole in the back.
