        Today, we worked on our websites for 15 minutes so that the people at open house 
        could read through actually good websites. For anyone on open house reading this, 
        Hi! I'm Greg. My website already looked like this, I just changed the typing on 
        the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday pages. After that, we continued working on our 
        boats (see Monday and week 13).
