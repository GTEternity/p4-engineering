        Today, we started going into business engineering, and we modeled our projects after shark tank.
        So, we had to come up with an idea that didn't exist by itself, but could be inspired by other 
        stuff. For inspiration, I called upon my hatred of sporks to make a better version of them: 
        Foons (fork spoons). A foon is a spoon that has prongs that can go forward to make it a fork.
        We didn't really have a better idea than that, so we went ahead and made slides on Foon.
