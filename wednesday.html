    <h1>Assemble RGM, Day 2</h1>
    <h3>September 14</h3>
    <p>
        Today, we finished the pulley supports, and after a bit we 
        figured out how we'll do the pulley system. It's quite a bit 
        different from the TinkerCAD design, but at least it will work.

    Here's a picture of the RGM mid-development:
