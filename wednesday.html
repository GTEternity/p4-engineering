    <h1>Assemble RGM, Day 4</h1>
    <h3>September 21</h3>
    <p>
        Today, we had to do MAP testing at the first half of th period. 
        But then the school WiFi crashed because everyone got on too fast. 
        So after that, we tested our machine, and it didn't work.
        We tested again, and it didn't work because the car did a sick flip. 
        And then we tested again, AND IT WORKED! AND WE GOT IT ON CAMERA!
