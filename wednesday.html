        Today, we went into chemical engineering, and we had a challenge: <br><br>
        The problem: A lake has bromide, chlorine, and sunlight, which makes it carcinogenic. <br>
        The lake is 10 acres on its surface. <br>
        The lake has 60 million gallons of water. <br>
        The lake is used by 600k people<br><br>
        My solution: put $2,537 of microalgae in the lake. It will cover the entire lake in 7 days, thus cutting 
        out the sunlight and not making it carcinogenic. <br>
        Real life solution: $136,000 of shade balls (400k).<br><br>
        I like my solution more.
