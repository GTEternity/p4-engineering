    <h2>Weeks 14-15</h2>
    <h3>Spaghetti Bridges</h3></center>
    <p>
        The project: Build 4 prototypes and 1 final bridge with only 100 sticks of spaghetti, with maximum 
        20 sticks per bridge. Wood glue can be used to hold the bridge together.
        <br>
        The bridges will be scored by the wieght they hold vs. how much they weigh (in-class competition 
        score, not grade score).
        <br>
        My group: Jonah Barty, Theodore Perry, and Taylor Larson.
        <br>
        Bridge 1: "The Line" - 6 columns of 3 sticks of spaghetti put together end-to-end in a line.
        Held a full bucket, was the best design.
        <br>
        Bridge 2: "The Rod" - 3 attatched parts of 6 sticks spun into a wire. Wood glue was literally 
        poured on it, therefor it's full bucket strength isn't as impressive as the line.
        <br>
        Bridge 3: 6 strips of 3 spaghetti connected side-by-side. 1 of them was used to make 2 X’s 
        at the end, connected in the middle by the other one. Random in-between parts to take the tension.
        Pretty meh.
        <br>
        Bridge 4: Similar to bridge 3, but has an X in the middle as well. The X’s at the edge cross 
        closer to the end. Like bridge 3, pretty ok.
        <br>
        Bridge 5 (Final): a lot like bridge 3, but with more rungs. Unfortunately, some unfortunate 
        happenings fell on the bridge and it was missing an end and a rung. It weighed 16.3g, held 
        687g of water, and had an overall ratio of 42.1. We got 5th place if you don’t consider the 
        cheater rod.
