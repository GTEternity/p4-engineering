    <h1><center>Week 6: Computer Engineering & Laptop Dissection</center></h1>
    <p>
        On Monday, we went into a new unit. I was ecstatic when I heard it was Computer Engineering.
        Computer Engineering is basically the programming and assembly of computer components to
        make a computer that does at least 1 task. In Computer Engineering, there are embedded systems,
        which are computers that are specially programmed and assembled to do 1 task. Think of video 
        game controllers, or TV Remotes, and stuff like that. Starting Wednesday, we dissected an old and 
        dead laptop. My partner was Kaitlyn (I think I spelled that right), and we learned where different components 
        in a computer are. For example, the laptop has a copper heat sink that's right below the CPU. 
        And then it was Friday. Kaitlyn was absent so I had to dissect the laptop myself. Although I was offered 
        to have another partner, I wanted to do it by myself anyways. I was done dissecting it, so I had to put it back 
        together. From this, I learned that it's tough to remember all the different screws used, especially because 
        some of them were missing from the beginning.
