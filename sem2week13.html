        <h2>Cutting boards and building walls</h2>
        <h3>April 10th - 14th</h3></center>
        <p>
            So this week, we started cutting. The first thing we did was cut out triangles
            for the edges of the boat. For the first triangle, I marked a height of 2 feet 
            and a width of 3 feet, and then I used a yardstick to draw a line to connect 
            the ends. For the 2nd triangle, we tried tracing the first one but the lines 
            were wack because Brandon cut the triangle in a bit of a wack way. Oh, by the 
            way, I'm the one who draws with pencil and sharpie, Brandon cuts most of the 
            time, Jonah cuts sometimes and sometimes helps me with drawing, and Towa helps 
            me with drawing as well. We kept getting our stuff stolen so we just wrote all 
            four of our names on our stuff. We were able to cut out 2 walls for a triangle.
