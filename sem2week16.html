            This week, we got our tape, which means no more infinite tape hack (aka bringing 
            your own from home). But, we manage to finish the 1st layer of our boat and we 
            added the rectangular base for the 2nd. The carbord we got for it is quite strong 
            but not quite long enough. So, we decided to make one of the triangles have an end 
            sticking out the bottom to make up for the missing part of the rectangle. Also, we 
            managed to make surprisingly good oars. But the highlight of the whole week was the 
            Segregator. The Segregator is a labeled piece of cardboard that goes across the width 
            of the ship at the middle to keep the shape of the ship and to reduce area that water 
            can get in. We also used a single piece of cardboard as a base and put it diagonally, 
            which made it surprisingly strong. Long live The Segregator (the boat one, not the 
            racism one).
