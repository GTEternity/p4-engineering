    <h1>Semester 2 Week 3</h1>
    <h2>5-week project: Arduino car</h2>
    <h3>Jan. 23rd-27th</h3>
    <p>
        This week, we started doing projects. Me and Jonah (Barty) became partners for it and we decided to do the 
        Arduino car. For our parts we decided on the following: An Arduino UNO REV3 SMD, a 6-pack of mini-breadboards, 
        an infrared controller with a receiver, a 9-volt battery, a jack connector for it, and this set: 4 wheels, 
        4 motors, 2 motor drives, and 40 of each type of wire - in-in, in-out, out-out. It's all about $65-$67 
        depending on how much 3d printer filament we end up using. However, we already have some of the stuff. So 
        the cost of the things we don't have is $55.21, not too bad for a $100 budget. We learned how to do a 
        proper research report (which was 5 pages of my life that I am never getting back) and search things up.
