    <center><h2>Test Bottle Rocket</h2></center>
    <p>
        I was absent on Monday, and my group couldn't work on the rocket because I couldn't send the CAD. On Wednesday, 
        we started building the rocket. We had to redo some parts of the CAD, like making the cone and some fins taller, 
        because the original measurements didn't work. We still managed to build the rocket in a single day, though.
        I was very confident in the rocket I designed, surely nothing bad could happen (obvious foreshadowing alert).
        Then, the main twist was revealed when we got onto the field: although we were tested for distance, it's being launched
        up. The bottle is better going up because it's a rocket instead of a plane, there were just wings to adjust to the 
        horizontal distance challenge, so the rocket design would prevail. And everything was looking good, I even 
        adjusted the rotation of the rocket so that the wings would be in the right position. And then the rocket takes off.
        And it goes backwards. What happened was the bottle had a leak. A LEAK. The best result was a plane. Looking back, 
        we should've asked for less pressure, though that wouldn't matter with a leak.
