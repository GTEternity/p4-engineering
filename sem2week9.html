        <p>
            So this week (or rather Thursday only) we did a challenge where we had to make a gutter boat. 
            We had a few balloons, a cup, 4 popsicle sticks, 2 rubber bands, 2 straws, a pipe cleaner, 3 safety pins, and 2 sheets of carboard paper. 
            We went with a design where we put a cup on the end of a balloon shaped like a pear, and then attached a rudder made of a cut straw and 
            pipe cleaner with 2 perpendicular popsicle sticks tied using rubber bands. I thought it could slowly propel the "ship" forward. 
            Little did I know that the rudder would reach the bottom of the very shallow gutter and stop the boat from moving. Eventually, we got it 
            to reach 2'3" forward (which happened because we were allowed to breathe on it 4 times). If I were to change anything while keeping 
            the design the same, I would have shortened the rudder sticks. If I were to change the design, I would rather have a half-cup with a sail.
