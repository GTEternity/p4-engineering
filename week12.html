        <p>
            So, this week was a short week and I came in late on Tuesday. 
            But, I did learn quite a bit. When I came back from my appointment on Tuesday, I saw a lot of 
            electronics and breadboards. Why did I have to miss the fun day? Anyways, there were Arduinos 
            connected to laptops that were controllable power sources (3.3V and 5V as options). There were 330 Ohm 
            resistors so that the LEDs won't burst. I wish I took a picture of the breadboard, but I was too busy 
            looking at how everything worked. The people there were Sebastion, Leon, and someone else who's name I 
            don't remember. They explained what was going on and how they connected the stuff, and they even managed 
            to get a push button to work. We discussed if we could have a button that turns one light on and another 
            off. SUrprisingly, there's a solution: If there's a regular push button and a reversed push button that 
            are pushed at the same time or maybe connected and then they each go to a different LED, it would work. 
            Thursday, we had a challenge: Calculate the time in hours of taking a math class for 50 minutes a day 
            for 180 days, or counting to a million. It takes 150 hours for the math class. For counting, I measured 
            9 seconds per 10 digits. So I did the math from there (shown below) and I got 1635.804 hours. And then 
            it was revealed that I got the closest answer. Massive W.
