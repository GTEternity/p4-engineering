        <h2>Cardboat Boat Design</h2>
        <h3>Apr. 3rd-7th 2023</h3> </center>
        <p>So we had a new project for the next few weeks: making a cardboard boat. And 
        not some flimsy tiny little thing that could barely hold a marble, I'm talking 
        structurally sound actualy boat that holds two people. And we're going to race
        with them. I'm with Towa, Brandon, and Jonah again, and my original sketch <i>was</i>
        looking good until I realized how wack it was and I instead reverted to a diamond 
        with 1.5ft walls. We decided on a different design in the TinkerCAD and we even made 
        a net of it. In the following images: 1 inch in TinkerCAD is 1 foot in real life 
        (except for thickness, which is 3/16 in. for cardboard).</p>
