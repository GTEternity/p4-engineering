    <h1><center>Week 4 Review</center></h1>
    <p>
        This week, we worked on our Rube-Goldberg Machines. 
        We managed to get quite far, we only need to make the top part of the pulley, which won't take long.
        We finishe the ramp, the support for the pulley, and the box for the ball.
        We also managed to work out how we tie the strings of the pulley through the box.
        It looks quite a lot different from the original CAD.
        We didn't finish this week because we had a challenge on Friday.
        And boy. do I have something to say about that challenge.
        The challenge was to make a paper boat that could last 5 minutes on water.
        If there were several boats that could last 5 minutes, whoever carried the most weight won.
        So we went with the strategy of "make a boat and don't put much weight".
        And then it turns out that the best way to win in a class all about being inventive was to not be inventive.
        The best solution was a flat piece of paper, which makes sense because the wide surface area could support the most weight.
        But it still doesn't feel like the essence of engineering.
        Then again, engineering is about working smart and having efficient solutions.
