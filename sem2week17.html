            This Week, we were able to finish decorations on our boat and we made it look 
            like a shark (Brandon's idea that made TinkerCAD hell). We also put the Burger 
            King Whopper Song on a side and named the ship "The King of Burgers" because 
            Brandon's initials are B.K. Then, we worked on paper roller coasters. The 
            requirements are that the marble must never stop moving and that there must be 
            at least two loops. So far, we have a sideways loop, but I think we need to start 
            from higher so that the loop will actually work.
