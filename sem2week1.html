    <center><h1>New Semester</h1>
    <h2>Shark Tank</h2>
    <h3>Jan. 9th-13th</h3></center>
    <p>
        On monday, I learned that I forgot some stuff that I learned last semester. 
        We did a kahoot about stuff we learned last semester, and not only did I get 
        some stuff wrong, my kahoot crashed. On wednesday, we started going into 
        business engineering, and we modeled our projects after shark tank.
        So, we had to come up with an idea that didn't exist by itself, but could be inspired by other 
        stuff. For inspiration, I called upon my hatred of sporks to make a better version of them: 
        Foons (fork spoons). A foon is a spoon that has prongs that can go forward to make it a fork.
        My group (me, Brandon, Towa, and Jonah (Barty)) didn't really have a better idea than that, 
        so we went ahead and made slides on Foon. On friday, I added the final picture for Foons on 
        the slides, and the presentation couldn't look any more scuffed. We were able to prove why 
        sporks are clearly inferior and annoying and mediocre and bad. We listened to other people's 
        presentations (my favorite was the ICUP one bc it was ridiculous with their $8 caps). Our 
        presentation was flawless, but we were barraged with sensible questions that made our product 
        look as bad as it was (not as bad as sporks though). Also, we didn't do enough research 
        regarding the price (it would've been about $1 instead of $2).
