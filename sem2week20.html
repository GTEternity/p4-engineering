            So this week, we finally tested our boats for the final. When we were taking our boat for 
            testing, the top fin was missing, so we took off the other decorations and just had the boat 
            go plain. So, we went to the CV pool and we were some of the first groups who were ready at the 
            start. So, our group and three others went first, and Jonah and Towa were able to get in the 
            boat without it sinking, which is a good start. They were the only ones who didn't sink almost 
            immediately after the round starting, and they managed to get our boat all the way to one end 
            without sinking. They then got out because the boat would probably sink on the way back and 
            they didn't want to sink. Our boat was still in recognizable shape after. But now, I want to 
            talk about the true MVP: The Segregator. Without the Segregator, the walls would've collapsed 
            in on themselves, water would get in, and the boat would sink. The segregator saved our boat.
