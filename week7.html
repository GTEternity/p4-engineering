    <h1><center>Week 7: Bioengineering</center></h1>
    <h3><center>and a little bit of trolling</center></h3>
    <p>
        This week, we learned about bioengineering. Bioengineering is basically the application of 
        biology in engineering. Its uses are in the medical field mainly, as it can be used for 
        medical equipment or prosthetics mainly. I'm not too interested, but my brother is studying 
        to be a doctor and he was once interested in engineering, so maybe he would like it. On Wednesday,  
        designed prosthetic limbs, but not what you might expect. We had to choose our favorite animal 
        (except dog or cat) and design a prosthetic for it. I chose to design a prosthetic tail for a 
        spider monkey. It isn't my best work, but I couldn't find all the information I needed. I 
        couldn't find the diameter of the tail or what material fits best for 6 pounds over 24-36 inches. 
        On Friday, we wrote instructions for a PB&J sandwich. And someone else would do it WORD FOR WORD. 
        As someone who has programmed before, I covered basically everything, even down to the thickness of 
        the PB and the jelly. However, I failed to account for cleaning up and opening the jars. But that's not it. 
        I volunteered to build one of the sandwiches with the worst instructions, and I did a little bit of trolling. 
        Since coming to highschool in freshman year, I knew I wanted to be a computer hardware engineer. This class 
        definetely gave me a look at the job, and I think I like it. So we were told to go on Indeed and search 
        for a job we want, and I found nothing that said "Computer Hardware Engineer".
