            So this week, we finished building our boat. By that I mean we decked out the bottom with tape. 
            We also finished our paper roller coasters. We weren't able to get the 2nd loop in time, but it's 
            fine because we added 3 ENTIRE FUNNELS. Let me explain: the funnel at the top is to give some 
            freedom as to where we drop the marble. The funnel right after the track is to catch the marble 
            no matter how far it flies or how much it curves in. The 3rd funnel is directly below the 2nd 
            funnel and it's only function is to funnel the marble from a wide opening to a small pipe going 
            down into the box. AND IT WORKED. Except we probably will get a few points off for not having the 
            vertical loop but whatever, funnel supremacy.

        The completed coaster (notice the funnels). <br><br>
