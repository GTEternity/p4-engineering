        Today, we learned about bioengineering. Bioengineering is basically the application of biology in engineering. 
        Its uses are in the medical field mainly, as it can be used for medical equipment or prosthetics mainly.
        I'm not too interested, but my brother is studying to be a doctor and he was once interested in engineering. 
        Maybe he would like it.
