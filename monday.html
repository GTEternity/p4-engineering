        Today, we were able to make 2 more walls that will go on the 2nd triangle (see 
        week 13). We also started discussing how we will make the walls for the long sides 
        of the boat. I think that we should get two pieces of carboard, tape them side-by-side, 
        and make sure that measures to 4.5'. Some of the other (I forgot who) think that we 
        should overlap the two pieces of cardboard. If we do that, it's on them to change that 
        one the TinkerCAD because it's their idea so L. Towa also drew a picture of a buff 
        cartoon cat (picture coming soon).
