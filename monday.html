    <h1><center>Mechanical Engineering</center></h1>
    <h3>Definition:</h3>
    <p>an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and
    <br>mathematics principles with materials science to design, analyze,
    <br>manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It is one of the
    <br>oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.</p>
    
    <p>Don't worry, <b><u>we were taught the proper safety procedures, but we haven't used them yet.</u></b></p>
    <p>Mechanical engineering opens up into:
    <br>CAD, manufacturing, thermodynamics, material science,
    <br>fluid mechanics, and structural analysis.</p>
    
    <p>There are also simple machines, which are basic mechanisms that do basic tasks.
    <br>These are:
    <br>Wheels and axles: used to move things in something like a cart.
    <br>Levers: Move something up when something weighs upon the other side.
    <br>Pulleys: Use one thing going down to move something on the other side up.
    <br>Inclined Planes: Ramps to move things down (or sometimes up).
    <br>Wedges: Put something in between 2 other things to move them apart.
    <br>Screws: Can hold things together or convert rotating force into linear force.</p>
