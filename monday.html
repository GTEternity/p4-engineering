        Today, we didn't learn much. Because it's the first day back, we just had some fun. 
        However, I didn't know what seat to sit in, the one I sat in for the bridge project or the 
        one I sat in beforehand. I sat in my original seat, but Jonah and the guy to my right sat in 
        the bridge project seats. We then all got sticky notes and had to write words on them, pass 
        them to someone in our group, get one from someone and put in on our foreheads, and take turns 
        guessing. I gave Jonah my sticky notes, which was beans. I got the sticky note of the guy to my
        right, who wrote paper towel. Jonah passed his paper to the girl behind me to my right, whos 
        name I forgot due to my goldfish memory, who then passed her paper to the guy to my right, 
        which said door. I guessed first, and it took me a while to get the answer right. Jonah got his 
        pretty quickly. We thought the paper on the guy to my right said "deer" at first, but it was 
        actually "door", like I mentioned earlier. He was so close to getting the answer a lot, but in 
        the end he finally got it. Then we did a kahoot, and not only am I forgetting some of the stuff 
        I learned, my kahoot crashed.
