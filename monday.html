        Today, we learned about Arduinos. Basically, you can make an account on the site and then code stuff that gets compiled 
        and then uploaded onto an Arduino. pinMode sets an integer variable as a pin and it could be either an input or output, 
        and digitalWrite basically sets electricity to the part that corresponds with the pin. I also learned that Arduino's 
        website is trash because when my mom tried to confirm my account it didn't for some reason.
