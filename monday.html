        So today was kinda meh. We only got 2 motors and 2 wheels, and a big breadboard. We might be able to get 
        a mini one, and also maybe a remote. If we don't get it, I'll "conveniently" get one from home because 
        I REALLY want to make that work. Jonah agreed to 3d print 2 wheels, so we'll just have those be there 
        but not attached to motors. Also, I realized (after Jonah told me) that we can turn by just slowing one 
        wheel and speeding up the other.
