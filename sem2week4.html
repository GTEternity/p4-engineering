        On Monday, we had to add to our research because it aparently wasn't enough. However, because we researched 
        more, we found out that we didn't even need bluetooth, we could just use infrared to send and read signals. 
        This was all possible due to IRremote, a library for Arduino that reads infrared signals and decodes them. 
        This is possible because the remote we were going to use comes with an IR receiver. However, we did need to 
        get a mini-breadboard for it. On Wednesday and Friday, we were designing our projects in TinkerCAD. Jonah 
        and I had slightly different designs, but both could still work. Apparently, 1 motor controller could only 
        control 2 motors at a time, so we ended up using both included in the set.
