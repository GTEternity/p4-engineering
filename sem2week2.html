        Monday was MLK Jr. Day, so we had no school then. On Wednesday, we went into chemical engineering, and we had a challenge: <br><br>
        The problem: A lake has bromide, chlorine, and sunlight, which makes it carcinogenic. <br>
        The lake is 10 acres on its surface. <br>
        The lake has 60 million gallons of water. <br>
        The lake is used by 600k people<br><br>
        My solution: put $2,537 of microalgae in the lake. It will cover the entire lake in 7 days, thus cutting 
        out the sunlight and not making it carcinogenic. <br>
        Real life solution: $136,000 of shade balls (400k).<br><br>
        I like my solution more. <br>
        On friday, we made oobleck by mixing water and corn starch. Me and Jonah made it together, and we saw how it's liquid-like if you don't 
        appoach it quickly, but if you hit it fast, it acts more like a solid. Oobleck also seems to have a powdery texture on the inside, though 
        you won't be able to tell unless you taste it. (What? Both water and corn starch are edible.)
