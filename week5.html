        On Monday, we checked up on our RGM, when all of a sudden, 
        we see it broken because it was knocked over. The ramp lost 
        stability, the top of the pulley system lost firmness. 
        But then, the day after, we used the one thing that solves 
        literally every problem: duct tape. After further adding to 
        the feats that duct tape is capable of, we tested our machine. 
        Tests one to (I think) 3 failed because either the car missed 
        the balloon or the car just did a sick backflip because of how 
        the baseball hit it. But around test 4 or 5, everything went 
        right. The pulley worked as intended, the ball stayed in the 
        box until it hit the ramp. The ball went straight down the 
        ramp. The ball hit the car. And the car popped the balloon. 
        From this, I learned that trial and error is a HUGE part of 
        the engineering process. Things will NEVER work first try because 
        there's ALWAYS something you didn't think of. On Friday, we went 
        to Mr. Kim's class, and I learned that my class isn't as creative 
        as theirs. The stuff I saw in there was really cool.
