            This week, we did a challenge. The goal: create a bookshelf that stays up when someone slaps 
            it and can fit basically any common book shape using only paper and scotch tape. So, the usual 
            squad started brainstorming when Jonah came up with something BRILLIANT: makeshift cardboard. 
            By folding a piece of paper into a zigzag and then taping paper to the top and bottom of it, 
            it becomes a lot stronger structurally and just becomes bad cardboard (maybe you could make a 
            boat out of it?) and you can use it to hold things together. So, we started with a cardboard 
            base, then inwards-tilting cardboard walls to hold a book, then cylinders of paper filled with 
            other paper on the bottom in the middle to be inner support. Then we had walls on the outside 
            and then outer cardboars supports to stop it from flipping. While making that last part, we 
            basically made it unslappable. Ultimate bookshelf (real).
