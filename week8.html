    <h2>Design Bottle Rocket</h2>
    <p>
        Ok so this week was weird because we had classes on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. What happened is that Wednesday was PSAT day and Friday was a 
        minumum day. So on Tuesday, we were introduced to a project: design a bottle rocket that's designed to go horizontally. Any thrust/propultion 
        will be supplied by the teachers using some air pumping machine next week. All we had to do was lessen drag as much as possile. The first thing 
        we did was make a Build for Materials board, or BOM for short (but I like to say BOMB). Our supplies include cardboard, tape, a bottle of our 
        choosing, paper, and maybe some materials from home. We were told to be creative, but creativity might lead to a loss in functionality. So I 
        was creative <i>about</i> functionality. So I sketched a nose cone and fins on a 2L, which is very basic, but that's when it hit me: a sideways 
        rocket is just a plane. What do planes use to stay in the air? Wings! Unfortunately, the shape of the best wing is too hard to make with 
        cardboard, especially on such a small scale. So instead, I just decided to use flat cardboard at an angle, 25 degrees to be exact. I didn't put
        much thought into the angle, but it made sense to me: it would get more air under the rocket while not having as much drag as, say, 45 degrees. 
        So, after I was done sketching, I made a TinkerCAD design, and I must say it looks pretty good. On Thursday, we had a challenge: make a flying 
        piece of paper that will hit a bucket when thrown from the 1000 building balcony. And then my mind went to the paper boat challenge. And then I 
        realized: the best solution is the most simple one. So I used my 1 piece of paper and crumpled it up into a ball. Me and Theo did this, and then 
        Aaron did it too, and then even more people started doing it. And when we went out to the balcony, like a 4th of the people there (incliding Mr. 
        Kim's class) was throwing little paper balls at the bucket. What I learned is that the planes are very inconsistent because they're PLANE flimsy (laugh.). 
        The balls were overall closer to the bucket, but some planes got closer. If I had a better throwing arm. I would've done better. Unfortunately, I wasn't here on Friday, I was sick.
