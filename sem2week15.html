            This week, we continued building boats. We shortened the length of the rectangular base 
            of the boat to 3 and a half feet. We were also able to attach two walls to each of the 
            triangles, finishing them. We then spent the rest of Wednesday and all of Friday connecting 
            them. The only thing that isn't connected entirely to the rest of the boat is one of the 
            long walls, since I didn't have enough tape (I brought my own so I could tape entirely). 
            During this, Jonah and Towa were testing our protoboat, and it was able to hold 4 bricks. 
            It could've held more had there not been a leak.
