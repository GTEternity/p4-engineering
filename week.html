    <h1><center>Week 3 Review</center></h1>
    <p>
        This week, I learned that simplicity and precision are key when designing. 
        Simple designs are better because they're easier to measure precisely, 
        and they're also easier to make precisely. Precision is key because a small 
        mistake might be at the cost of the structure of a whole part of something. 
        It also just helps make the proportions right. Accuracy is also super important 
        because anybody else who's constructing what you design knows exactly what to do. 
        For the sake of clarity, never leave out any measurements and make sure that 
        measurements add up. An example of simplicity being good is my Rube Goldberg 
        Machine and Aaron's. While Aaron's is definetely cooler, my design is simpler 
        and thus easier to make (except for maybe the bowls). However, an important 
        factor that must cooperate with simplicity is creativity, which Aaron's 
        design definitely has more of.
