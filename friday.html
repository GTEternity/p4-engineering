    My half of the class was told to find out how many doors there were in CV. The other side was told to 
    find how many doors there are. Winner is the one with the biggest number. The thing that made us win: books.
    Book covers and pages are just doors to the next page. So, we estimated that the library had 5000 books with
    an average of maybe 300-500 pages each. We got a number in the millions. Apparently, the wheels would've won 
    if they made a better arguements. I then got a $5000 bounty for teaching the Gospel of the Books.
