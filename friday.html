    <h1><center>Challenge 3: E</center></h1>
    <h2><center>Design & Cut</center></h2>
    <h4><center>September 9</center></h4>
    <p>Today, we had 10 minutes to design an E.
    The minumum height/width is 3 inches, and the maximum is 36 inches.
    I made mine based on everything being 1 inch.
    Then, we had to switch with someone else, and we were given 15 minutes to cut out their E.
    I switched with Dylan, and our E's are shown belo.
    Personally, I think my E was better.</p>
