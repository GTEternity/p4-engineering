    <h4><center>September 16</center></h4>
    <p>Today, we had a bit of time to make paper boats that would
    have to support weight while on water for 5 minutes. I made a weak-looking 
    canoe (I've never made a paper boat before). On my team, team 2, 
    we chose a standard-looking paper boat.</p>

    <p>We ended up putting 15.8 grams, and we were feeling confident 
    until the boat tipped over.</p>
