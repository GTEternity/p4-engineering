        Today, we got new tape, Gorilla tape. Except I brought my own (and then ran out). But, we 
        managed to do quite a bit of taping with mine, we were able to secure the triangles and one 
        of the long walls. The prototype boat was tested and it held 4 bricks before sinking because 
        of an unseen leak.

    <br>The corner where it's dipping is probably the one with the leak. <br><br>
