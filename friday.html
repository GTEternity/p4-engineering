    <h4><center>September 2</center></h4>
    <p>Today, we had 40 minutes to design a home appliance of our
     choosing in TinkerCAD. I chose my beautiful red toaster oven,
     and then I turned it into a shoddy microwave.</p>

     <p>What's more is that whoever did the best design on each half
      of the class would get a kitkat. My hopes were high when the
      judge said that my design looked good, but then someone else won.
     Good on them, though.</p>
