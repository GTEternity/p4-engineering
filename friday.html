        I added the final picture for Foons on the slides, and the presentation couldn't look any more 
        scuffed. We were able to prove why sporks are clearly inferior and annoying and mediocre and bad. 
        We listened to other people's presentations (my favorite was the ICUP one bc it was rediculous with 
        their $8 caps). Our presentation was flawless, but we were barraged with sensible questions that 
        made our product look as bad as it was (not as bad as sporks though). Also, we didn't do enough 
        research regarding the price (it would've been about $1 instead of $2).
