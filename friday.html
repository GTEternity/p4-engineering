    <h1><center>Challenge: Build PB & J</center></h1>
    <h2><center>But with a twist</center></h2>
    <h4><center>October 7th</center></h4>
    <p>The task: write exact instructions for a PB & J sandwich.
    <br>
    My goal: be exact so that nobody could possibly mess it up.
    <br>
    The problem: 10-15 minute timer, and I write slow
    <br>
    My 2nd goal: do a little bit of trolling
    <br>
    I did succeed in a little bit of trolling.
    <br>
    By that I mean I made someone else's sandwich in the worst way possible.
