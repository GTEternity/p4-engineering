        <p>
            This week, we were <i>supposed</i> to build small prototypes of our boats on Wednesday, 
            but we forgot and started making more triangle walls with plans to make an extended body. 
            We started and finished our prototype on Friday, and we decided to do every length at a 
            1/4 scale. We figured out where we needed to tape, how parts would attach, and how attaching 
            layers would work. Unfortunately, we weren't able to test it because we started late. The 
            way everything was attached felt pretty natural and we also only used 2 layers for the boat 
            to keep the smalled feel but still experiment with several layers. Thankfully, we now have a 
            good idea as to what our boat will look like.
