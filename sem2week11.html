      <h2>Egg Drop: Building and Testing</h2>
      <h3>March 27th-31st 2023</h3>

    <p>
      This week, we started building our designs for the egg drop. Wednesday was entirely for building, and we managed to 
      build the popsicle stick cage for the egg. We used a bunch of tape and string to to keep it all together. MVPs were 
      absolutely Brandon, who was really good at tying through small spaces, and Towa, who was able to undo double-knots. 
      Friday, we attached the straws, the parachute, and the balloon. It's not exactly accurate to the TinkerCAD, but it's pretty close.

      A few pictures of the build: <br><br>

      When we tested, apparently our egg already had a crack in it (not our fault). On the first attempt, the wind blew it 
      into the column above the stairs where we were testing. It would've definitely kept the egg safe had it not already 
      been cracked. <br><br>
